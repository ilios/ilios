### Prerequisites

Some samples require PHP and Database support. By default they use SQLLite
database ( samples/common/database.sqlite ), but you can reconfigure samples
and work with MySQL, to do so

- import dump samples/common/dump.sql
- comment SQLite section and uncomment MySQL section in 
  samples/common/config.php

PHP connectors supports MySQL, MsSQ, Oracle, FireBird, SQLite, PostgreSQL, SQLAnywhere
For Java and .Net you can grab connector packages with scheduler's samples from 
http://dhtmlx.com/docs/products/dhtmlxConnector/index.shtml
