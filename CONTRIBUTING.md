# Contribute to Ilios

So you want to help out with Ilios development?  **That's Fantastic**.  Here is 
how you can get started:

## Overview of the process
1. [Initial Setup](#initial-setup)
2. Create a branch for your work
3. Make some changes and write tests
4. Run tests to ensure your changes haven't adversely affected other areas of the system.
5. Commit your changes with a good [Commit Message](#commit-message)
5. Push your feature branch to your fork of Ilios on Github
6. [Create a pull request](#create-a-pull-request-on-github) so we can review, discuss, and merge your changes.

## Initial Setup
1. Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free)
2. Fork the repository in GitHub with the 'Fork' button

## Running Tests
1. [Run PHPUnit tests](tests/phpunit/README.md)
2. [Run Jasmine tests](tests/jasmine/README)
3. [Run Behat tests](tests/behat/README.md)

### Commit Message

Some good rules for commit messages are

 * the first line is commit summary, 50 characters or less,
 * followed by an empty line
 * followed by a longer explanation of the commit if necessary

The first line of a commit message becomes the **title** of a pull
request on GitHub, like the subject line of an email.  Including
the key info in the first line will help us respond faster to
your pull.

### Create a Pull Request on Github

Go to *your* GitHub repository at
https://github.com/my-github-username/ilios, switch branch to your
topic branch and click the 'Pull Request' button. You can then add further
comments to your pull request.
